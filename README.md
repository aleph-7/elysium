## Software Requirement Specification Document

## Software Design Document

A software design document (SDD) describes software created to facilitate analysis, planning, implementation, and decision-making. This explains how a software product or a feature will be built to meet a set of technical requirements. If the requirements document describes the "what" of your project, the design document focuses on the "how".

## Software Implementation Document

A software implementation document (SID) is a document that describes how a software product is built to meet a set of technical requirements. This document talks about implementation details like integration, CI/CD, hosting, VCS; it provides a surface-level overview of codebases and completeness of the application.
